My MAUI App

Welcome to the My MAUI App repository! This document provides you with instructions on how to get started with the app development using .NET MAUI on Visual Studio.

üöÄ Prerequisites

Visual Studio 2022 (or later)
Ensure you have the latest version with .NET MAUI workload installed.
You can download it from Visual Studio's official website.
.NET MAUI Workload
If not already installed, open the Visual Studio Installer and modify your installation to include the .NET MAUI (Mobile and Desktop) workload.
Mobile Development Emulators
For Android: Ensure you have Android Emulator setup.
For iOS: You need a Mac connected to your network for deploying and debugging. Also, ensure that Xcode and the necessary simulators are installed.
üîß Setup & Run

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/MyMauiApp.git](https://github.com/thatmissedsemicolon/MAUI.git)
2. Open the Solution in Visual Studio
Navigate to the directory containing the .sln file and double-click to open it in Visual Studio.

3. Select your Desired Deployment Target
In the top toolbar:

For Android: Select the desired Android emulator/device.
For iOS: Select the desired iOS simulator/device.
4. Build and Run the App
Press F5 or click on the Start Debugging button to build and launch the app on your selected target.

üì¶ Required NuGet Packages

For this project, we utilize several essential NuGet packages to enhance its functionality:

1. Newtonsoft.Json
Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.

bash
Copy code
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
2. System.Net.Http
This namespace contains the HttpClient class for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses from a URI.

Note: Starting with .NET Core and .NET 5, System.Net.Http is part of the .NET runtime, meaning you don't need to install an additional package for it.

üí° Tips

In case of any build errors related to NuGet packages, try restoring the NuGet packages or cleaning and rebuilding the solution.
Always make sure your emulators are up to date and you've installed the necessary SDKs in Visual Studio.
If you're experiencing issues with hot reload, ensure that you're using a supported emulator/device and that you have the latest updates installed for Visual Studio.
